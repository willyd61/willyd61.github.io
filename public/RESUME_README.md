# 📄 Add Your Resume PDF Here

To enable the "Download Resume" button on your portfolio:

## Instructions

1. **Export your resume as PDF** from your preferred format
   - Recommended: Use the uploaded resume files as source
   - Keep file size under 2MB for fast downloads

2. **Name the file exactly**: `resume.pdf`

3. **Place it in this directory** (`public/resume.pdf`)

4. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add public/resume.pdf
   git commit -m "Add resume PDF"
   git push origin main
   ```

The download link in your portfolio will automatically work once this file is added.

## Creating from Uploaded Files

You have these resume files in your uploads:
- `Lipford__Will_RC.pdf`
- `Lipford-Resume-Profile.pdf`

Either:
1. Use one of these directly (rename to `resume.pdf`)
2. Or create a new updated version based on the portfolio content
